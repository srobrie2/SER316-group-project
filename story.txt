This is the beginning of the story:

One day, there was a dog baking a apfelkuchen.
He could only bake while wearing lederhose.
People would walk into his baeckerei and see him in his lederhose and laugh.
He was bitter, so he turned off the Klimaanlage in the baeckerei. 
He wanted all the customers who laughed at him to suffer in the heat while they pick up their brot and geback. 
However, one day the nice man who worked at the biergarten across the street came into the shop. 
The biergaten worker invited him to a wettbewerbsfaehig Schloss building contest.
Little did he know the nice man was actually quite wettbewerbsfaehig.
The biergaten worker saw a mehlhase while at the wettbewerbsfaehig Schloss building contest.
